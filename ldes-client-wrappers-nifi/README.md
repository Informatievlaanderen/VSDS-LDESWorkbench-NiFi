# LDES Client wrappers NiFi

This module contains the Nifi processor (LdesClient) that wraps the LDES client.


## Build the processor

To build the project run the following maven command:

```maven
mvn clean install
```

This will build the processor NAR file (Nifi archive).
When the NAR file is placed in the `lib` folder of your NiFi installation, you can add the processor in your workflow.

## Using the Components 

The NAR files generated by a build of the [LDES Workbench NiFi repository](../README.md) will contain multiple LDES NiFi Processors. Below follows a short description how these can be used.
